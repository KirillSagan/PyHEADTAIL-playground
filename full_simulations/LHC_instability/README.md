# Example for a PyHEADTAIL simulation

This PyHEADTAIL script models the interaction of the CERN Large Hadron Collider beam with the beam coupling impedances in the machine.

The setup here runs with a strong transverse damper at 1/(50 turns) damping rate, as well as a chromaticity of 12 tune units, which stabilises the beam.

To observe a clear instability signal, switch off the damper and choose a smaller chromaticity close to zero.
